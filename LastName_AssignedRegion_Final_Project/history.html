            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>The PNW was originally home to a large number of Indigenous groups, including the Coast Salish, Chinook, and Nez Perce, who thrived on the abundant marine resources and forests. Their rich cultures, based on salmon fishing and cedar wood carving, still influence the region today.</p>
            <p>In the 18th and 19th centuries, European and American explorers arrived, drawn by the lucrative fur trade and timber. The subsequent establishment of ports like Seattle and Portland cemented the region's importance as a gateway to Asia, leading to rapid growth driven by the Gold Rush and the lumber industry.</p>
